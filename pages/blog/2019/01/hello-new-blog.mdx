In the process of creating a new blog on my own, I made a variety of choices under technical, financial or time constraints. In this article, I write about what constraints I had and what choices I made within those constraints, in case I read it in the future.

Note: I'm not claiming that this is the best configuration for creating a blog for yourself in 2019.

## TL;DR

- I decided to create a blog because I wanted a place to practice the web skills I'd caught up on after my job change and implement recommendations.
- It's deployed on [GitHub Pages] and uses [Next.js] as a framework. The article is written using MDX notation, which allows you to write JSX in Markdown.

## Background and Motivation

Why do I need to create my own blog in 2019? If the goal is to have a blog, then use a service for that, so it goes without saying that implementing and maintaining it makes sense in and of itself.

I've been working as a web application engineer for several years, but at the end of this month I'll be changing jobs and doing something different from web application development at my next job. However, I want to continue catching up on web technologies, and I want a place to put that catch-up knowledge into practice. So I decided to create this blog. While blogging services are convenient, there are many things you can't do from a security standpoint, so they don't serve this purpose.

From February, I will be working on areas such as search and recommendation from a data science perspective. There are many books and blogs that use static documents in these areas, but since I'm familiar with the web technology, I thought that I could make use of it to create content that can be changed dynamically. To do so, I need to be able to run JavaScript freely, and I want to manage that code with git. I also plan to use it as a place to put the recommendations and search knowledge I've learned into practice.

### Development Requirements

When it came to building a blog, it was important to me that I could build it before my next job started, and that I could continue to maintain it in the future. It will be difficult to achieve this unless I can make use of the knowledge I have at hand, rather than learning a new technique from scratch for this project.

The configuration should also be simple for ease of operation. However, writing raw HTML / JavaScript / CSS is hard to maintain, so I decided to use a static site generator. It's a blog, so it's contents are mainly static text, but I want to incorporate rich content, so I needed support for document and JavaScript integration.

Since it's 2019, HTTPS is a must, even for a static site.

## Technology Stack

On the basis of the above, the following stack has been adopted::

- Host on [GitHub Pages]
- Deploy with [GitHub Pages Deployment] of [Travis CI].
- Use [Next.js] as a static site generator.
- Write blog contents in [MDX].

UPDATE: This blog is deployed by GitHub Actions now. Travis CI is no longer used. ([Read more.](/blog/2019/10/github-actions))

### Static Site Hosting Services

GitHub Pages is a static file hosting service that integrates with GitHub. [Recently, HTTPS was finally supported for custom domains](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/).

There are many other options for hosting static site, but I decided to use GitHub Pages because I wanted to host my other project pages on GitHub in the same domain as my blog, and because I'm simply used to using it.

### Deployment Automation

Since I'm using GitHub Pages, the deployment is done with a git push to GitHub. I looked at Travis CI and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) as CI services to automate this work. I'm used to using CircleCI, but I've adopted Travis CI because I can use [GitHub Pages Deployment].

If I push to the workspace branch of the yuku/yuku.github.io repository on GitHub, it will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages from Travis CI.

### Static Site Generator

I had decided to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for client-side JavaScript to make use of the knowledge at hand, so I looked at [Next.js] and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Gatsby was attractive because it has a more specialized atmosphere for static sites, but since Next.js also uses static export to create https://nextjs.org, it's hard to think that it will suddenly end support. In the end, I decided to use Next.js for the following reasons:

- I've used a bit in the past.
- The documentation was easy to read (for me).

[![Next.js vs Gatsby](/static/images/2019/01/next-vs-gatsby.png)](https://www.npmtrends.com/gatsby-vs-next)

There didn't seem to be much of a difference between the two in terms of the number of NPM packages downloaded or how active their development was.

### MDX

When trying to use JavaScript in blog content, the problem is how to load JavaScript code, and I wanted to avoid writing `<script>` directly in an article.

[MDX] is a format that allows you to use JSX in Markdown. In a nutshell, the React component is automatically mounted in the place where JSX is written. It is not a widely used tool, but it is developed by ZEIT, the developer of Next.js. Even if MDX will be shut down, all I have to do is create a DOM element in the place where I wrote JSX, and explicitly mount React components to it. It's easy to migrate.

## Conclusion

In this article, I gave a brief summary of why I decided to create my own blog and the tools I chose. As I wrote at the beginning, I don't think this is something I can recommend to everyone, but I hope it's a reference for anyone, including my future self.
