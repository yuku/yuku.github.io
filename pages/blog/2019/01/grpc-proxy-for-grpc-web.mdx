When I read the gRPC-Web documentation, I was surprised to see [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) used without any explanation:

> In this example, we will use the [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) proxy to forward the gRPC browser request to the backend server. - [gRPC Basics - Web](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/web.html)

gRPC uses HTTP2. Since modern browsers are able to communicate over HTTP2, I don't see the need to set up a proxy if I support only such browsers. Why do I need a proxy like Envoy nonetheless?

## Browser Restriction

There is a hint in the documentation describing the gRPC-Web protocol:

> decouple from HTTP/2 framing which is not, and will never, be directly exposed by browsers - [grpc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md at master · grpc/grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/f0bfcd864c7a2395ad82ff9db8e39d0c51d49ee0/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md)

In short:

- JavaScript running in the browser does not provide full control over HTTP2.
- The gRPC protocol uses features of HTTP/2 that cannot be controlled by JavaScript.
- So that a proxy is required.

And I think the restriction will never be removed.

## Why Restricted?

Why am I so sure that browser will keep the restriction?

The reason can be explained by considering the position of HTTP2 in the public Web. HTTP/1.1 has been used on the Web for a long time. So you can expect your web servers to be able to communicate over HTTP/1.1. However, it is not clear whether they can communicate over HTTP2. Therefore, a browser uses HTTP2 if it can communicate with a web server over HTTP2, but otherwise, it will fall back to HTTP/1.1.

Also, because of the concept of layered architecture, Web application must not know whether HTTP2 or HTTP/1.1 is used under the hood. This means HTTP/1.1 and HTTP2 must be able to be handled transparently so that browser will never provide a way to control a feature only available in HTTP2 by JavaScript.

gRPC uses the such HTTP2-only feature.
