I have implemented continuous delivery of Google AppEngine applications using CircleCI:

- Deploy to staging on pushing to `master` branch.
- Deploy to production on pushing a tag matching `/^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`.

This configuration is quite useful and I'm sure I'll have a chance to reuse it. In this article I describe the implementation details.

## Create a Service Account

At first, I created a service account that will be used to authenticate Cloud SDK in CircleCI:

1. Create a new account at [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) of Google Cloud Platform Console:
   - Named "circleci" to make it easy to guess what is's for.
   - Created a key and download it in JSON.
2. Attach roles to the created service account at [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) page:
   - App Engine Deployer (`appengine.deployer`)
   - App Engine Service Admin (`appengine.serviceAdmin`)
   - Cloud Build Editor (`cloudbuild.builds.editor`)
   - Storage Object Creator (`storage.objectCreator`)
   - Storage Object Viewer (`storage.objectViewer`)

Note that it may take a few minutes for the results to be reflected.

When you create a new GCP project, a `xxx@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com` service account which has a Cloud Build Service Account role is created. You also need to attach the following role to the service account:

- Storage Object Viewer

## Configure CircleCI

My GAE application uses `nodejs10` runtime. I added following npm run scripts:

- `npm run test`
  - Run tests
- `npm run build`
  - Build project and put artifacts to the `/build` directory.

And I implemented CD using those scripts.

### Cloud SDK

I use [google/cloud-sdk](https://hub.docker.com/r/google/cloud-sdk/) image which was described in [How to Use Google Cloud SDK Using Docker](/blog/2019/01/google-cloud-sdk-in-docker):

Set the downloaded JSON key as `GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY` environment variable, then do following command to authenticate Cloud SDK:

```bash
echo $GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY | gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=-
```

### workspace

Build artifacts (generated by `npm run build`) are required to deploy.

Node.js is required to run `npm` command but the google/cloud-sdk image does not contain Node.js runtime. There are some way to solve this problem:

1. Create a Docker image with both Node.js and Cloud SDK and use it.
2. Store build artifacts somewhere and use it in the Cloud SDK container.

I started by 1. but finally found that [I can use workspaces to share files across jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#using-workspaces-to-share-data-among-jobs) so adopted 2.

### Deploy

`gcloud app deploy` command deploys your application to GAE. I used the following options:

- `--version`
  - Give the version name.
  - You can replace an existing version by specifing the same version name.
- `--no-promote`
  - Don't route traffic to the newly created version after deployment.

## Conclusion

You may think it's hard to set up continuous delivery in the early stages of a project. However, from a medium- to long-term perspective, I think these efforts are worthwhile.
