Rich snippets are now displayed when the URL of a blog post is shared on Twitter or Facebook, in support of [Open Graph protocol (OGP)](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started).

During development, I implemented it by referring to the documents, and checked it using the debuggers provided by Facebook and Twitter:

- [Card Validator | Twitter Developers](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
- [Sharing Debugger - Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/)

[The Facebook's spec](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters) requires `fb:app_id`, so I created a new project for this blog on Facebook and registered that ID as `fb:app_id`. According to the old information on the web, `fb:admin` was also supported in the past, but now it seems to be unified into `fb:app_id`.
